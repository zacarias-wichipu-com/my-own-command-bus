### Exercise description

PHP implementation of the [Dojo made in Ruby](https://github.com/franiglesias/ruby-dojo/tree/master) by [Fran Iglesias](https://franiglesias.github.io/) to show the design of the Command pattern and the management of different messages (commands and events) through buses.

The exercise includes as challenges the creation of a simple command bus and a simple event bus and the publication and consumption of messages through them, allowing the extension of the behaviour of the application through the use of middlewares.

Fran Iglesias' blog posts explain in a masterly, clear and concise way the structure and behaviour of message transport buses in the object-oriented model. Attached are the entries that have served as a guide for this exercise:

- [Como funciona un bus de mensajes](https://franiglesias.github.io/command_bus_1/)
- [Disfrutando del Command Bus](https://franiglesias.github.io/command_bus_2/)
- [Mensajer√≠a variada](https://franiglesias.github.io/command_bus_3/)
